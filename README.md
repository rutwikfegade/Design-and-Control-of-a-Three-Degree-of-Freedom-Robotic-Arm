# 3-DOF-ARM
Robotic arm with three degrees of freedom that uses a servo motor and push buttons.

The robotic arm was built using 5mg servo motors. The purpose of this ProjectÂ was to develop a method for precisely controlling each arm joint with a push button. Each servo is managed by a single push button. Overall, there are four servo motors and five pushbuttons to operate them. Since the arm must also reverse its motion, the fifth pushbutton is utilised to control the motor's direction. The fifth button switches the motor's direction between backward and forward direction.

## Operational Highlights:

Single Push Control: The design ensures that each servo motor is managed by a single push button, offering users a streamlined and efficient means of controlling specific joints.

Directional Reversal: The fifth push button plays a pivotal role in switching the direction of the motors. This feature enables the robotic arm to perform intricate motions by smoothly transitioning between forward and backward directions.

Enhanced Manipulation: The combination of servo motors and push buttons empowers users to manipulate the robotic arm precisely, opening possibilities for applications in various fields such as education, research, and prototyping.
