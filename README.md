## 3-DOF-ARM
Robotic arm with three degrees of freedom that uses a servo motor and push buttons.

The robotic arm was built using 5mg servo motors. The purpose of this project was to create a way to operate each arm joint with a push button. Each servo is managed by a single push button. Overall, there are four servo motors and five pushbuttons to operate them. Since the arm must also reverse its motion, the fifth pushbutton is utilised to control the motor's direction. The fifth button switches the motor's direction between backward and forward direction.
